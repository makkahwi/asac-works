Big O indicates the complexity of an algorithm. It involves 2 basic indicators, time complexity and memory (space) complexity. In other words, Big O describes how long time the algorithm needs to be executed, and how much of space it would occupy once executed. Now in case of having no variables (user input or random generated) to the algorithm, probably the execution time and space would be fixed which is presented by O(1).Otherwise, the indicator should be a formula which consider how many or how big the variables are.
