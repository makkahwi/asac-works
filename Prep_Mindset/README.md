IT field is contantalty upgradable field with new technologies introduced almost every single day, n no way to survive within the field without hunting and keeping up with the latest by actual coding & practising. Practicing the same form of coding everyday doesn't really upgrade one's technical skills, as long as it's not a new challenge you put yourself before. So the key word is to keep oneself challenged at all times by practicing new approaches / methods / skills / languages / techs n so on. In other words, the old mindset of keep practicing the same work with the same tools for years & decades don't help the worker much in the IT industry and would result for her/him to be left behind.

From a learner perspective, n despite the surrounding environment, one need to believe in their ability to learn, adapt and grow. The key is to realize that the suffering you experience while learning new things is the process of rebuilding your mindset to absorb whatever you're learning. So the pain / exhaust / boredom / desperation felt while learning is actually an indicator that your mind is in the process of adapting and growing. Hence, one need to rebuild the impression of the learning suffer as a prove against the ability to learn to the opposite.

In addition to the results of second summary above, the constant hard working behaviour of the individual trying to learn / adapt is the other side of the same coin. Having some long-term goals, and to have a passion & self-motivation is the force power behind the hardwork one need to have all the time to move forward and succeed.

## *[A kinder, gentler philosophy of success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)* A kinder, gentler philosophy of success

The main idea is basically to admire the success-driven sense the humans now have more than ever, the sense to have an end game or goals to follow and to be persistent behind those goals. But it draw attention to make sure that we're following what we really believe that we want to have, not what was picked for us by others. And also to believe that they're is no such thing as totally successfully and have no failures. Whatever success is made in a specific life aspect, there must be failure in some other aspect(s).

### Self-Assessment Results

Self-Awareness: 21
Self-Management: 20
Social Awareness: 16
Relationship Management: 18

Basically no new insights on those as I had several tests similar to this one, of which may find the links for in my resume website. Anyway, the results point to the fact that I have a high self-related but low social-related skills. N I believe this was the reason for me to easily adapt to the coding when I made my most recent career shift to programming about 4 years ago. Of course I still need to work on my social skills for non-coding tasks like presenting, discussing and human interactions, especially as someone who's planning to start my own IT business soon.Probably starting my own business and being forced to engage more with others as a team leader / marketing agent n such roles a startup gonna need me to do will help to push up those skills.

I believe that I didn't spare any effort in my self explore journey in the past decade, in which I made career shifts between 3 major titles: secretary and financial manager, graphic designer & software developer. Holding different job titles and being part of 12 organizations between 2008 & 2021 were the main factors to sharpen my experience in defining myself (strengths & weaknesses) and what I want to do n what I want to reach n so on. It was also the lead of growing my people-related skills (which used to be much worse) as those experiences involve working with people from all four corners of world.
