## Summary of [Article: Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in 15 minutes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/)

It's a guiding article for developers in general so they could avoid cummlinating small mistakes which eventually would get in their way while developing a software n pull them down. The article pointed down few concerns to keep in mind.

1. To keep reminding yourself as a developer about the purpose you're serving by building the software. 
2. To remember while coding that there is a good chance that the code will be dealt with after a while, either by you or a fellow developer, so make your code readable and maintainable. 
3. To make sure that you're always aware of what are you building n what is the technical detailed reason for it.
4. Keep your software design & code as simple as possible by keeping it about producing the expected result, nothing beyond. 
5. Keep updating and upgrading your app. This includes fixing popup issues and keep adapting the latest and most advance approaches. 
6. Keep the code parts which belong to the same software alike as much as possible. In other words, keep your code harmonies and build in a unified approach within a one software.
7. To build the software with most-important-first way, meaning to build the most vital parts first, and then later on you may develop these parts to have the secondary & less important features.
8. Follow the local Arab saying "To understand the issue is the first half of solving it".
9. Don't keep seeking perfection because it isn't approachable, and follow the point mentioned above about prioritizing.
10. "Solve the problem before it happens" is an endless game, don't overthink about the future issues n keep your head into the current ones.
11. You don't need to start from scratch everytime, find a relevant effort that was already made and build on it.
12. Depend on the machine as much as you can, n keep your time for something a machine cannot do by itself.
13. Measure your work by asking how good your code solve the attended issue.
14. Keep testing your code by running each finished part solely, and don't hold the testing till you finish the software.
15. To have a better time estimation, be precise about it by breaking down the big problems to small ones.
16. Fix what you have and don't rebuild it.
17. Keep tracking and documenting your working by committing it.
18. If an outsourced code doesn't truly contribute to solving the issue, don't waste time with it n make your own.
19. As your code needs to have updates with the latest, so do you.
20. Pick your battles.
21. Don't rush into asking others to fix an issue for you, squeeze yourself first n get close as much as you could.
