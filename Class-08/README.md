# Unexpected Parts of the Experience

Today I learned about the classes and objects of Python. What are the exact differences, and what is the syntax to use each of them.

Classes are used for object-oriented programming. They're defined using a syntax that's almost similar to defining a function in Python. Classes do contain attributes which defines the structure of the class. They could be used in many different ways like building input forms n making sure of the input structure before sending data to DB.

Objects on the other hand are the results of sending data to classes. Classes in Python -or most of coding langs for that matter- are used to generate data in a fixed structure, which could be useful to ensure that needed data is passed to the machine.
