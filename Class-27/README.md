## Django Models

### What did I learn today?

How to build models in Django. That includes to work with the initial database system used (sqlite).

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

 I just need a way to remember doing the make-migration & migrate commands whenever there is an update to the models. Other than that, everything is crystal clear. I even went the extra mile on my own n started to work with static files & styling frameworks like bootstrap.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

It's very clear at this stage, as I had an experience with Laravel PHP which follows almost exact same approaches to build models.

### What should I do differently next time?

As nothing new really was learned, I was supposed to try n do the bit more advanced work in class time like intermodel coding.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

At first submission assignment wasn't submitted due to delays on my side. But on second submission, the requirements were supposedly fulfilled without any issues.
