## Web Scraping

### What did I learn today?

How to scrap a web page n extract the data for processing / analysing.

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

All right

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

It's a bit confusing about the web page scraping ability, by experience it seemed like some web pages are not scrapable. So it's a question on the criteria of scrapable websites & web pages.

### What should I do differently next time?

None. I already experienced scraping too many sorts of websites and webpages.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

Yes without issues.
