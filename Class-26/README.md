# Django

## Learning Journal 26

### What did I learn today?

How to setup Django n build a basic web app. That includes initiating an SQLite database and creating the admin user to access the admin panel. It also included a simple introduction to models & included creating some static views.

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

I liked the fact that the admin panel is built-in feature. In some similar MVC framework, a library need to be called to have an admin dashboard. I already made my own "how to create" manual so I wouldn't forgot the steps.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

I'm a bit confused about the installed packages location within the project. Unlike Express.Js & Laravel PHP, I can't find a directory with all libraries installed within.

I'm also a little unclear about the built in views (TemplateView / DetailView) n how do they work.

### What should I do differently next time?

Aside from the splitted assignments of labs to be given to practice this, I probably should start a whole web app Django-based project on my own. That would help me probably to get a head start n to have a chance to clear the puzzling parts to be faced while building the whole app.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

Completed without any problems.
