# Learning Forces

## Original Text

"What motivates adults to find time for their learning in their busy schedule? Mostly intrinsic motivators; self-esteem, self-confidence, desire for better quality of life, curiosity, self-development, and recognition are only a few factors that motivate adult learners to learn. Needless to say, intrinsic incentives are much more powerful than extrinsic ones, and thus adult learners, more often than not, are more satisfied with the learning process, more focused, more persistent, and more eager to apply their knowledge more frequently and successfully than younger learners. On the other hand, children and teenagers are mostly motivated by extrinsic factors, such as getting good grades or other perks, or avoiding the consequences of failure."

## Reflection

As mentioned in my resume website, I'm someone with a burning desire and endless curiosity to learn new things. I also feel more alive as I test myself and succeed in learning and gaining new skills, instead of sticking to same set of skills. I'm also occupied with the idea of finding the best fit for me, n I don't easily take the idea that a comfortable working field is an absolute fit for me. I have made three major career shifts (beside some minor ones) in the past decade, all of which were our of curiosity and trying to find the best fit for me.
