## Linear Regressions

### What did I learn today?

How to Run Linear Regression in Kaggle (with Python Code) using sklearn library

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Quite clear and understood

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

None

### What should I do differently next time?

Try to implement it with bigger and more complex data structure as I think this would spark some issues and enhance understanding.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

Yes but late submission
