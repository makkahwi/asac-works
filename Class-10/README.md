# Retrospective

## Learning Journal 10

### What did I learn today?

I learned what are the linked lists are, what are the advantages and disadvantages and how to use them in Python. I also enhanced my understanding for the classes & objects in python (going through the Lab 4 solution).

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

### What should I do differently next time?

It would be preferred to code while the instructor is explaining a python feature so any related concerns could be raised @ the lecture n to cement the practical understanding of the feature.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

A bit confused about the real use-cases for linked lists.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

No Issues at assignment
