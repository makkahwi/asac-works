## Game of Greed

### What did I learn today?

Game of Greed, a simulation to what have been learnt so far. It included using several classes with many related methods. Applying tests & using fixtures was part of the practise.

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Except for what was noted below, it was fine. Especially working is coders coming from different backgrounds & levels of experiences.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

It was a bit confusing to expand the application of so-far learned to such complix & dynamic application.

### What should I do differently next time?

It seems like I had to start an own project to gather all so-far learnt Python knowledge with complex applications.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

Yes, was submitted fully on-time.
