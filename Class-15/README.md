## Trees

### What did I learn today?

Tree data structure. What defines a tree? What are the parts that make a tree? How to traverse a tree? What are the type of trees? How to calculate the Big O of trees?

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Nothing to be confused about n mess up.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

None

### What should I do differently next time?

To implement both traversal approaches instead of sticking to one only.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

Yes, without any issues.
