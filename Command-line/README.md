# Command Line Summary

## *[The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)* The Command Line

Command-line of any OS is basically a "text-based interface" to deal with the OS and it's software / exe(s) without using the GUI of that OS. So as text interface, it works by typing and sending in commands following the syntax of the OS terminal, and results will be shown back in texts as well. It's reachable within linux in Applicantions -> System / Utilities. But for Windows OS user like myself, it could be reached by Start -> Windows Systems -> Command Promt.

When you start linux terminal, it by default start from the home directory, which isn't really the top directory within the system. The basic navigation tools are three. First, 'cd' which stand for change directory. It helps users by moving to any other accessible directories of the system by typing down the path to reach the designated directory starting from current one. Second, 'ls' command to list down the contents of current directory. Third, 'pwd' to show us the path of current directory.
