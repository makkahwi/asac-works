# Unexpected Parts of the Experience

I'm a bit confused about the meaning of "this experience". So I'll reflect assuming that the meant experience is the bootcamp we're invovled in.

As a sort of an old hand at coding, so far I haven't really learned any new skills or gained any significant new knowledge out of this course. But the most unexpected outcome was to observe the pain and suffering of my fellows who are totally new to the coding field. After exercising coding for long time, one tend to forget that learning how to code is really a tough mission and make coders' community sort of a narrow one.

As I didn't learn any coding-related skills so far, I admit that it's been a learning journey about how to push myself to be part of such an activity where I won't get any new skills till quite a while of putting up with going through the already obtained basics of software development. It pushed up the limit of the boredom pain I could take to reach the anticipated goals.
