## Linked Lists

### What did I learn today?

What are linked lists, and how to use them in Python.

Linked lists are a sort of open-end arrays / lists. Where user / app could store limitless count of stringed (chained) data. The only difference between arrays & linked lists is the fact that linked list items are to be stored separately on machine memory. The way these separated data to connect to each other is to use pointer (address holder) of which signifies the chained item location.

The linked list is to be defined as a Class, with initial data structure of a value holder and a pointer holder. It may contain several pointers or several separate data holders.

    def __init__(self, value1=default_value,value2=default_value, ...):
        self.preperty1 = value1
        self.preperty2 = value2
        self.pointer1 = None
        self.pointer2 = None
        .
        .
        .

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Concept is quite clear.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

It's still a bit confusing what are the actual uses of the linked lists which make it diffrent from arrays / lists.

### What should I do differently next time?

To explore the uses of acutal real-life uses of the data structure at hand.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

No issues there.
