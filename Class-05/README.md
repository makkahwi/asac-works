# Big O

Big O is an indicator to the complexity of a problem solution for specific criteria like time consumption of space usage. It actually indicate the worst case scenarios of using the algorithm. The major concerns to indicate are the time complexity and space complexity. The process of analyzing either complexity includes considering 4 relevant factors of the algorithm. Those factors are input type & size, measurement units, growth order and the 3 cases (best, average and worst).
