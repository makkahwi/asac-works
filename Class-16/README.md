## Serverless Functions

### What did I learn today?

How to build simple api-like serverless functions. They would take input through URL params & return data in several possible forms.

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

It went fine. Data could be sent and received without issues.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

The actual possible uses of the serverless functions in web apps instead of building functioning within the apps.

### What should I do differently next time?

Involve the serverless functions in an already-built web app to figure the difference.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

Yes without issues.
