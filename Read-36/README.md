## Whiteboard Advice

[Source](https://hackernoon.com/the-best-whiteboard-interview-advice-i-ever-received-3ebbfa72e4a)

The core advice of the article is to focus on communication skills all along the whiteboard interview. Communication could even start before the interview time, like to get the specifications of what to prepare and bring a long. This reflects the mindset of planning and preparing instead of improvising & doing last-minute work.

So in an interview, when a candidate is given a problem to solve, they've got first to restate the question. This isn't only about ensuring their understanding of the issue to handle or to help yo calm down and start gaining self trust. What's more importantly is to reflect the communication skills of gathering the proposed problem to solve and own presicing & detail focusing.

Another part is not to assume but to ask. Propose what first comes to mind of edge cases, to check if interviewer wants the solution to address. Or again, for communication purposes, the very least to do is to share own assumptions as they're being made, yet it's even better to reflect the openness for suggestions.

Thirdly, check if there are specific tests the potential employer want to include. This shows more spacifices about the type and scale of solution to build, and presents the critical thinking and the TDD skills.

Next would be to build the Pseudocode and explain it as it's being built, and to get interviewer input. Which again would help to get more details of the client desired solutions & demonstrate the logical operation going throw the mind of the candidate. This even might take off the load of building actual code and earn a lot of points by this stage, especially in case time may not be enough for functional coding. Same process could be followed while build acutal code. To explain n get input and show logical flow.

In either Pseudocode or acutal code, it's not wrongful to ask for help in case of getting stuck at some point. It shows interviewee ability to work with others and get help to wrap up the job ASAP.

## 7 Tips

[Source](https://blog.usejournal.com/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6)

1. Take few minutes: don't jump to the explanation just to take own nerve down or to fill the silence. It isn't wrong to give seconds to thinking and preparing, and to give space for the otherside to spill all they've got.

2. Draft solution steps: it's better to organize and structure the solution on paper instead of keep imagining it.

3. Start with pseudocode: it's advisable to do pseudocode before actual code to test own algorithm and theory.

4. Don't get concerned about details: it's better to keep the effort and focus on the big chunks of the code work, the logical operations & solution steps flow.

5. Don't miss the non-techincal skills: it would be bad to derive total focus on programming / coding / problem solving and away from the basic skills to have like communication skills and personality reflection.

6. Get prepared: to be prepared and simulate some interview scenarios is the right thing to do. While presenting / solving problem it would be resulted if there was preparation work or not, which affects the interviewee points.

7. Recap own solution: there should be a time split dedicated to review the work before making a statement of "it's complete / done / this is it". Rushing into building the solution probably would cause to miss some parts which might be crucial for interview results.
