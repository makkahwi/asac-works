# Singly Linked List

To create a linked list class which includes a head and the methods of : insert, includes & to string.

## Approach & Efficiency

I created (Node) class which takes a value of any type as an argument and have a pointer of (None) type as default.
I also created (LinkedList) class which takes no arguments and create an empty linked list.

---

## "LinkedList" Class has following methods

- Insert, which do add a node to a linked list.
- Insert at Tail, which add a node to the tail of a linked list.
- Insert at, which add a node to the given index of a linked list.
- Insert Multi, which handles the addition of serveral nodes to a linked list.
- Length, which counts the length of a linked list n return the count.
- Remove Node, which checks the existence of requested index and then delete the corresponding node.
- Includes, which checks the existence of a node within a linked list.
- To String, which read n return a linked list as string / text.
