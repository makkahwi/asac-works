## Approach & Efficiency

The approach is basically about using a loop to go through the array elements. First to check whether the element is an integer or not, then a nested loop would be engaged to check if previous elements are bigger or not. If so,the element will be switched with the bigger one (pushed back in array order).

Big O:
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(x1)
