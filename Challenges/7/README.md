## Approach & Efficiency

"zip_lists" method was built to combine two exisiting lists to be one list using zipping approach (new linked list would include an item from first list, followed by an item of second list).

## "LinkedList" Class has following methods

- Insert, which do add a node to a linked list.
- Append, which add a node to the tail of a linked list.
- Append Multi, which handles the addition of serveral nodes to the tail of a linked list.
- Insert at, which add a node to the given index of a linked list.
- Insert Before, which add a node before a given node of a linked list.
- Insert After, which add a node after a given node of a linked list.
- Kth, which find an N node from a reversed linked list.
- Length, which counts the length of a linked list n return the count.
- Includes, which checks the existence of a node within a linked list.
- Zip Lists, which combine two exisiting lists into one zip list (alternate nodes of both lists).
- To String, which read n return a linked list as string / text.
