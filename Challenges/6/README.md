# Linked List Kth

To modify the previous "linked list" class to add the kth methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

"Node" class was created to absorb the value of an argument n have a pointer of none type as default.
"linked_list" class was built to create emply linked lists n then apply the within methods.

## "LinkedList" Class has following methods

- Insert, which do add a node to a linked list.
- Append, which add a node to the tail of a linked list.
- Append Multi, which handles the addition of serveral nodes to the tail of a linked list.
- Insert at, which add a node to the given index of a linked list.
- Insert Before, which add a node before a given node of a linked list.
- Insert After, which add a node after a given node of a linked list.
- Kth, which find an N node from a reversed linked list.
- Length, which counts the length of a linked list n return the count.
- Includes, which checks the existence of a node within a linked list.
- To String, which read n return a linked list as string / text.
