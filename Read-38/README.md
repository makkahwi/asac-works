## React - Conditional Rendering

[Source](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

It's basically about how to apply the conditional rendering for a component, where the component is to be rendered if the condition applies. So in case a specific data object need to be reflected in a specific view like a table, if condition could be applied to check if data exists so the view would be rendered.

        {data && (
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        {data.key}
                    </th>
                    <td>
                        {data.value}
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        )}
