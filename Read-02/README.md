# Lesson 2 Reading

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

*[Source](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)*

An approach to test the coded solution before actual deployment / release of the system, including all edge cases (possible scenarios of different outcomes) of code usages.

Simply, code a test to check having the desired outcome of a solution method (function). Then fill the function with the most simple solution that passes the test at running. Once the test is passed, you may start developing and complicating the solution and running the test every once a while to make sure that the algorithm still delivers the needed solution.

## Main Equal Name

While python executing a code, it sets a `__ name __`variable with a value of  `__ main __` for a module. And in case of importing it from another moudle, `__ name __` will become the module's name. It's available as value to `__ name __` global variable as part of helping with the import of modules.

## Recursion

*[Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)*

Recursion is what occurs when a method (function) call for itself, or when two methods keep calling each other. The method(s) should contain a conditional statement to either keep recursioning or to skip / pause. So in other words, it's a form of a loop as it does have an update for a value / statement & a condition to keep checking and eventually turn off the looping.
