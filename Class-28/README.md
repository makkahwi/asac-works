## Django CRUD

### What did I learn today?

The basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) operations in Django Framework.

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

I'm having a bit of confusion as I have worked before with MVC-based Laravel PHP, which have high similarity in how to do what was done in the recent classes. So I need to start listing down the steps on how to do the model building, routing, templates and views construction of Django to differentiate it from Laravel.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

Mentioned Above.

### What should I do differently next time?

Should build a base empty Django framework and fork on every new project instead of going through the steps from scratch every time.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

Completed without difficulties.
