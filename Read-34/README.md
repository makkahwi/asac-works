## Django Settings Best Practices

[Source](https://djangostars.com/blog/configuring-django-settings-best-practices/)

Issues might be faced...

- Different environments | In a web dev, it's always the best practice to have several envs for the several stages of build the project, like development env, production env & local env. Each would have own configs & settings to fit the purpose of the env and make most of it.

- Sensitive data | There always will be data that can't be shared like passwords & sercret keys. In such cases, the unshared files of .env are built to host store them in relevant envs without exposing them to the non authorized.

- Sharing Settings | While a development team is building a project, there are some settings that only those team members need to be aware of. So it's a trick situation of closed-circle share need.

The very best solution to overcome those issues is to involve *django-environ*. It's a library that deals the above-listed security and variety issues and provides an almost perfect solution for each of them.

## SSH Tutorial

SSH (Secure Shell Protocol) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable uses are remote login and command-line execution. SSH applications are based on a clientâ€“server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server.

Ass SSH is a client-server based protocol, the protocol allows a device requesting information or services (the client) to connect to another device (the server). So, when a client connects to a server over SSH, the machine can be controlled like a local computer. The server has a designated TCP port over which it monitors the network, waiting for clients to initialize the connection. Before a client connects and starts issuing SSH commands, it needs to pass the authentication process.

A complete understanding of the basic behavior of SSH will help users understand the security aspects of this technology. Most people find this process very complicated and incomprehensible, but it's much easier than most people think.

If it's questioned how lengthy it takes for a pc to calculate a hash and authenticate a user, well, it occurs in much less than a second. In fact, the most quantity of time is spent in moving statistics throughout the Internet.
