### What did I learn today?

This is the first experience in this course to work in Kaggle. So today's session was about being introduced to Kaggle UI & how to use it. Which is basically used for data science & data analysis apps among other uses like data visualization.

Data science concept was also introduced. Which is about extracting / mining / resulting new data by reading some existing data. In other words, it's about reading & analysis data to giver deeper insight on data involved.

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

For a graduate of Data Science & Computational intelligence, all the concepts introduced were quite clear.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

It's a bit confusing in work in the Kaggle environment. Vs Code provides a lot of facilitation which isn't available @ Kaggle.

### What should I do differently next time?

None

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

Was submitted late, but had no issues upon submittion.
