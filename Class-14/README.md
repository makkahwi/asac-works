## Data Visualization

### What did I learn today?

How to use Matplotlib library in Kaggle to represent data.

### What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

It's quite clear that it's basically about visualizing the data.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

Nothing

### What should I do differently next time?

Seems the library have endless options of data visualization, so I'd dive more into those options for some of the expected uses for the library in future projects.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

Submitted & got full mark
